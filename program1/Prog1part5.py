'''

Part 5 - Work with output. Must be named Prog1part5.py 
Same exact inputs and outputs as in problem as part 4, but must be done with exactly 1 print statement. 
This will require the use of the newline (“\n”) character.

'''

first = input("First: ")
last = input("Last: ")+"\n"
address = input("Address: ")+"\n"
city = input("City: ")+","
state = input("State: ")+" "
zip = input("Zip: ")

print(first, last, address, city, state, zip)
